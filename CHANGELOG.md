# Angular NgRx Getting Started: Changes to the project files

- September 2, 2019: This code was modified to Angular version 8 (v8). Changes include:

  - File changes as per generated by the v8 Angular CLI

  - New v8 syntax for lazy loading for stronger typing

  - Update to the arguments passed to the Observable subscribe method since the subscribe signatures that take multiple parameters are being deprecated. The current recommended technique is to pass in an Observer object or a single function.

  - Minor changes to pass latest linting rules

  - Addition of four runtime checks as part of the `StoreModule.forRoot` to guide developers following NgRx core concepts and best practices. These are currently commented out, but available by uncommenting them and instead commenting out the `StoreModule.forRoot` with no second argument. When they are commented out, you may see a warning about them in the browser console.

  This update does **NOT** include action creators, reducer creators, and effect creators. They will be coming in a later update.
